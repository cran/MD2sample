Description: The routine twosample_test() in this package runs the
    two-sample test using various test statistic for multivariate data. 
    The user can also run several tests and then find a p value adjusted for simultaneous inference.
    The p values are found via permutation or via the parametric bootstrap. 
    The routine twosample_power() allows the estimation of the power of the tests. 
    The routine run.studies() allows a user to quickly study the power of a new method and 
    how it compares to those included in the package.
    For details of the methods and references see the included vignettes.
